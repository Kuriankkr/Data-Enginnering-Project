# Udacity-Nanodegree-Data-Enginnering

This repository here is has the projects that I have been doing as a part of the Udacity Nanodegree Data Engineering program. It finally has the capstone project that I did as a part of the Data Engineering nanodegree program that I had to complete to graduate
