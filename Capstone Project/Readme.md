## Capstone Project

This project takes in two sources of data: Immigration and Temperature. The idea is to take this data sourced from US cities. The data gets transformed in a relational data model that is optimized to analyze to immigration events. The database then can be used to understand immigration patterns with respect to temperature in US cities.

## Data Sources
